        <h3 class="pad-me">Nail art</h3>
        <p class="pad-me">There are so many different ways to do nail art! My favourite method is stamping <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@qinynails/video/7013995040729009414?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id6923883689877734918" target="_blank">(example of stamping)</a>. Other well liked methods are freehand, glitter placement, using striping tape or nail vinyls, or nail stickers or nail decals! You can create gradient looks, add loose glitter or matte top coat to make the design matte. Using different nail polish formulas will also give very different vibe to the look! Combining different formulas and methods can create so many amazing looks, just let your creativity guide you!</p>

        <h3>Skeleton Nail Art</h3>
        <p>I achieved this look with stamping. Base color is 'Heavy Metal Mixtape' by Holo Taco. I used a stamping plate by Born Pretty Store, and their white stamping polish.</p>
        <p>First you apply the base color normally. After it has dried well you can stamp the image on. You need a stamper, scraper and a stamping plate. Stamping polish can be regular opaque polish or a special stamping polish. I prefer to use stamping polishes because they tend to work better but each to their own!</p>

            <h3>Feather Nail Art</h3>
            <p>Now here's a fun look! All you need are feathers, and a lot of top coat. I used Ciate nail feathers, but you could use any feathers you like, craft store or feathers by a wild bird too if you're feeling wild and want to scavange in nature! </p>
          <p>After you apply the base color, add top coat. Without letting the top coat dry, press the feather onto the nail. Cut the excess and apply more top coat until the feather is secure and the nail is relatively flat. And voilá, elegant feather nails!</p>

                <h3>Fall Nail Art</h3>
                <p>Now for this look you need more time and ingredients. First the reciprocal gradient is done with using striping tape, make-up sponge for the gradient and then the apple bushels are nail decals. I got these of Aliexpress, you can find a lot of designs there, or elsewhere where ever nail equipment is sold.</p>
                <p>Reciprocal gradient is created by first doing normal gradient. Then add striping tape on the nail and do another gradient IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.</p>
