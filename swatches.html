      <h3 class="pad-me">What is swatching?</h3>
      <p class="pad-me">Swatching is a term used to describe the process of "testing" products. For example if you put eye shadow on the back of your hand to see how it looks on your skin, you are swatching the eye shadow. Nail swatching means applying the polish to the nail without adding anything else, for example nail art on top of the nail polish. Swatching and swatch pictures are good when you need to know how a certain product looks with your skin tone or how the formula behaves. Often the color may look very different in the bottle versus on your nails!</p>

            <h3>Glitterally Purple by Holo Taco</h3>
            <p>'Gliterally Purple' is from <a href="https://www.holotaco.com/" target="_blank">Holo Taco's</a> Remix Collection. This polish is a light purple glitter formula. Holographic glitter formulas usually have a clear base, like this polish, so that the holo glitter is able to shine through better. Glitter formulas can also be very difficult to remove, so using a peel off base coat is recommended! This polish is jam-packed with different color and size glitters, and it sparkles so beautifully in every lighting!</p>
