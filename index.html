            <p class="pad-me">Hi there, I'm Gini and this is my nail page!</p>
            <p class="pad-me">Here you will find nail swatches and nail art, as well as tutorials explaining the nail art process more thoroughly so you can try the looks yourself! I like to create simple looks rather than complex ones since I don't usually have a lot of time (or patience, lol). My favourite method of nail art is definitely stamping! Once you get the technique down, it's an easy way to create amazing designs without having to do freehand nail art.</p>

            <p class="pad-me">I've been doing nail art for a couple of years now, and my nail art obsession deepened during the pandemic.</p>
            <p class="pad-me">I don't use acrylics or other types of fake nails, and rarely use gel nail polishes. Not because I think there's anything wrong with them, I just like changing my nails so often that I prefer regular nail polish! So everything you see here will be done using my natural nails and regular air-dry nail polishes!</p>
            <p class="pad-me">I identify as nail polish addict (NPA) and holosexual - which if you don't know is a term created by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/simplynailogical/featured">Simply Nailogical</a> meaning someone who reaaally likes holographic nail polish! Drug store polish could never xD I hope you like it here, and I hope to see you over at my other socials!</p>
